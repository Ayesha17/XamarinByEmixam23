## Controls, extensions, applications examples over Android, iOS & UWP##

Sometimes with **[Xamarin][2]**, you're losing lot of time to search a way to make some controls, but you're losing also lot of time with NuGet packages.. Updates problems, something in the package is missing or doesn't work as you want, so that why **[XamarinByEmixam23][3]** has been  created !

The main goal of this project is also to make everything work over each plateforms. Currently, woindows phone is, at my point of view, placed to much next to **Android and iOS**, and it's annoying for peoples which have a **windows device**..

In **[XamarinByEmixam23][3]**'s project, you have two main folder, the first one is the **[Detailed Part][4]** and the other one *(not created yet)* is **App Examples**.


----------


## Detailed Part ##

In this section, you can find multiples folders which represents, each time, a control which isn't implemented by Xamarin Forms, an extension to make something easier, etc !

----------


## App Examples ##

App Examples is simply applications where some projects of the **Detailed Part** are using to show what you can do with some of them.
